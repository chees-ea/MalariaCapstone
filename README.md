# Malaria Capstone <br>

An automated system can help with the early and accurate detection of malaria. Applications of automated classification techniques using Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have consistently shown higher accuracy than manual classification. It would therefore be highly beneficial to propose a method that performs malaria detection using Deep Learning Algorithms. Objective Build an efficient computer vision model to detect malaria. <br>

**The objective:** <br>

Build a model that should identify whether the image of a red blood cell is that of one infected with malaria or not, and classify the same as parasitized or uninfected, respectively.

**About the dataset:**<br>

there are colored images of red blood cells that contain parasitized and uninfected instances, where: ● The parasitized cells contain the Plasmodium parasite ● The uninfected cells are free of the Plasmodium parasites but could contain other impurities
